## What is consistency?

Here are some things I learned during my hiatus detoxing from social media and my journey as founder over the past 2 years. It's crucial to engage in frequent and early self-reflection while consistently immersing oneself in a constant flow of information and knowledge irregardless of domain of expertise. Here are some key reflections I've gained from my experiences:

##Just start working

It sounds simple because it is. We spend too much time telling ourselves that things are “hard” when what we really mean is that they’re tedious, annoying, intimidating, or anything else.

Take the first step. Things are easier with momentum.

##Manage your energy, not your time

No matter how disciplined you are, some days won’t be as productive as others. That’s okay.

Know when to push yourself and when to give yourself a break. Burnout will always set you back further than giving yourself time to breathe.

##Recover productively

When you’re in a rut, spend time checking off the smaller tasks on your to-do list. If you don’t have the energy to focus on your main project, take care of a smaller task.

Productive recovery is essential to maximizing efficiency and mental health.

##Change Your Environment

Don’t underestimate the value of an environment that inspires you.

If you’re finding it hard to get started, try rearranging your workspace or finding a new one. Your environment should facilitate good habits and minimize distractions

##Set deadlines for yourself

When you don’t have deadlines, distractions feel excusable, and there’s no incentive to get started.

Reinforce that your tasks are priorities by holding yourself accountable.

Good deadlines are concrete, realistic, and meaningful.

##Establish a routine

Minimize the chance for distractions by creating and adhering to a routine.

Don’t overcomplicate your routine. Be thorough enough with your schedule to keep you focused, but don’t overdo it.

Start slow. Build discipline. Add more tasks as you scale.

##Use a to-do list

Lists are essential tools in maximizing productivity.

Break down your goals into actionable steps and order them based on importance, difficulty, and deadlines. Use these metrics to create a plan, then execute it.

##Manage your emotions

Not all tasks are enjoyable, but you can’t let that stop you. The work has to get done.

Incentivize yourself with rewards to push through the hard days, and remember that they are the stepping stones to the life you want.

##Increase your energy levels

Your brain needs energy to overcome procrastination. Here are simple things you can do to increase energy levels:

- Drink more water
- Get enough sleep
- Eat healthy
- Exercise regularly

##Forgive yourself for past procrastination

Procrastination is a part of growth. We all deal with it, but dwelling on lost time only results in more time being lost.

Forgive yourself for past mistakes, use them as inspiration to do better, and focus on building better habits.
