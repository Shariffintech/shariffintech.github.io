Discussing the significance of Education Technology in the modern education environment
I spent the last 9 months looking at the role of education technology and found how it has switched from being a supporting character for educators in the classroom into a dynamic lead in the role of improving child outcomes. Why? Because I believe the best products are built around the people who are closest to them. So when I was approached by my co-founder with this problem she was having with managing childcare data in her workflow, we uncovered a whole nesting doll of gaps in the childcare ecosystem and on a more macro level, inefficiencies in the education system, primary and secondary. This was in 2021 and before that, I was mostly focused on fintech, algorithmic trading, and Blockchain/Web3 and the issues they addressed [Investing in the Underbanked](https://shariftech18.medium.com/adoption-under-the-umbrella-of-fintech-2407f157ce5a).

While I'm still deeply passionate about these areas and plan to continue my work in those fields as they come together, there's something interesting happening at the crossroads of web3 and edtech that I'd like to highlight. For instance, there's a growing community called the [Ed3 Dao](https://www.ed3dao.com/), which I'm actively engaged with. Their primary focus is to educate educators about the web3 ecosystem, and I find it noteworthy. Orgs like ed3 DAO are important in the next gen of the internet because teachers already lack technical support within their system and the community of ed3dao gives them skin in the game.

Back to the problem…..

The challenge of managing student data in the classroom really resonated with me due to the tangled web of tasks in childcare. These fragmented workflows end up taking a toll on teachers' productivity over time. To make it more relatable, a close collaborator in my network with extensive experience in the childcare industry faces a tough time managing their data. As a new dad, learning more about their painpoints has given me a newfound appreciation for the importance of high-quality childcare. I would not want my son’s needs in the classroom to go unmet because of a staff shortage or crowded classroom. I am committed to continuing to learn more about the environments teachers lead our youth through and supporting our teachers to make more informed decisions in the classroom through building impactful software that can hopefully make a difference, so now I'm Investing in the overwhelmed and undertaught.

**Challenges and Opportunities in Childcare SaaS**

*Philadelphia & the administrative 4th wall*

Before even suggesting that tech be the cure all to solve the school systems problems I will be the first to let you know that is not the case, it is certainly part of the solution but there are other underlying factors that will improve the education system , the true catalyst, being the instruction from our educators who will continue to have the most impact on our students, we need to empower them; The legislation also gives educators a baseline to implement the effective curriculum, etc…

Technology has its limitations…… more screen time = more fatigue, reduced face to face interaction, concerns about data privacy and security, increased risk of amplifying *the digital divide*, where not all students have equal access to resources and tech. **Over relying on tech** can sometimes stunt critical thinking and problem solving skills (chatgpt) as well as distractions that affect students focus and engagement in the learning process. I experience this first hand as a software engineer and end up being counter productive when I’m solving bugs. I sort this out by resorting to doing a brain dump with pen and paper. These are just a few factors that could be counterproductive if we lean to much on the tech.

After doing more homework around the business of the education industry I found that childcare specifically has been [underfunded for decades](https://www.notion.so/c5322011e5544bc1aa6e187f8e0c4a85?pvs=21), resulting in a disproportionate supply of high quality programs and many families priced out of the system as a result of it. Providers or SMB childcare centers can only charge what families can afford, translating into low wages (with close to no benefits) for educators. This exact issue is why there is a revolving door within the childcare centers. As a result of the domino effect our children suffer.

Let's focus on some of the specific challenges the city of Philadelphia's education system faces for example.

These issues are not unique to Philadelphia alone but are indicative of broader challenges within urban education. By examining these obstacles, my goal is to gain insights into the broader landscape of our educational systems and workflows to ensure that every student, regardless of where they live, has access to high-quality education and a chance for success in school.

Philadelphia, just like many other urban areas in the US, faces a range of challenges in its education system that are not solely related to tech.

**Resource Inequality**

Did you know that over [60% of Philadelphia's kids](https://philadelphia.chalkbeat.org/2021/1/13/22230116/racial-economic-inequities-persist-in-philadelphia-schools-new-report-says) attend low achieving schools? Philly’s education system has an unequal distribution of resources among schools. Schools in low-income neighborhoods often have less funding, outdated infrastructure, and limited access to educational materials and extracurricular activities. These disparities result in a significant gap in educational opportunities and outcomes. 

**Teacher Shortages**

 [Philly has struggled with a shortage of qualified teachers](https://www.spaywall.com/search/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inquirer.com%2Fnews%2Fphiladelphia-teacher-quitting-attrition-rate-20230604.html), particularly in subjects such as math and science. This shortage can lead to larger class sizes, making it difficult for teachers to provide individualized attention to students and deliver quality education effectively.

**High Dropout Rates**

 High school dropout rates in some parts of Philadelphia remain a persistent problem. This can be attributed to many factors, including [disengaged students](https://www.spaywall.com/search/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inquirer.com%2Fopinion%2Fcommentary%2Fphiladelphia-mayor-race-teen-voters-20230330.html), inadequate support systems, and a lack of accessible extracurricular activities that keep students engaged in their education.

**School Safety Concerns**

Ensuring the safety of students and teachers is an ongoing challenge in Philadelphia. Incidents of violence in and around schools can create a disruptive learning environment and hinder the educational progress of students.

**Bureaucracy and Inefficiencies**

 The administrative structure of the Philadelphia School District has been criticized for its complexity, which can lead to inefficiencies and misallocation of resources. Streamlining administrative processes and reducing bureaucracy can free up resources to improve educational programs.

These challenges in Philadelphia's education system are indicators of broader inefficiencies that need to be addressed to provide a high-quality education to all students. These issues underline the need for a comprehensive approach to reforming the educational system, not only in Philadelphia but also in many urban areas, to ensure that every student has access to a quality education and equal opportunities for success.

**Machine Platform Crowd Parallels**

 It's just as if I'm reading the book ***[Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson](https://www.audible.com/pd/Machine-Platform-Crowd-Audiobook/B0731HG6JB?source_code=GO1GB547041122911G&ds_rl=1261256&gclid=CjwKCAjws9ipBhB1EiwAccEi1LICiAnPzH9c88tapR9kheRYpg7Ykq9Rnc9ddpf3_8p27OiGRBjHNRoCKFcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)*** all over again…only this time, I'm actually living it. That book is divided into three main sections, each being significantly relevant for the field of education technology:

**1st section**, **The Age of the Machine,** 
expands on the rise of machine learning, ai, and automation. Edtech in general has drastically evolved since this book was published and continues to use these technologies for personalized learning experiences, automated administrative tasks, and improved educational outcomes.

**2nd section**, **The Age of the Platform,**
emphasized the power of digital platforms in connecting individuals and organizations. Ed platforms have become pivotal in facilitating remote learning, maintaining global collaboration between educators, and offering a wide range of education content and tools. The pandemic accelerated the intermingling of these kinds of platforms into everyday educational practices.

**Last section**, **The Age of the Crowd,**
focuses on “the crowd” as a source of innovation and collective problem-solving. Crowdsourcing plays an important role in the development of open educational resources, curriculum design, and the evolution of teaching concepts. For us developers, an example of crowdsourcing is contributing to open source. I did notice that educators love using Reddit and Twitter to share tips in the classroom. Collaborative online communities and forums continue to provide essential spaces for educators to exchange insights, best practices, and mutual support.

These themes highly relevant to the dynamic and evolving landscape of education technology, where software is definitely eating the world.

**What I learned….Empathy and Compassion**

Education is not just about numbers and statistics; it's about nurturing young minds and fostering personal growth for our educators. EdTech doesn't replace empathy and compassion, but it can amplify these qualities. By allowing educators to better understand their students and their needs, it enables a more compassionate and effective teaching approach. This fusion of technology and humanity results in a more well-rounded education experience.

It took me awhile to write this essay but after reading Paul Graham’s  “How to Write Usefully” essay, I felt more at ease when I read the statement: *Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited resources.* so I started to document my journey.

As always here are some vibes for the road, stay tuned for my next post!
