Hi, I'm Sharif – an unapologetic tech enthusiast with a affinity for all things startups, especially in the fintech and SaaS realms. I find joy writing lines of code and late-night brainstorming sessions over some good matcha.

Here, you'll find me sharing my thoughts, insights, and even a few war stories from the trenches of the startup battlefield. It's not just about the latest gadgets or trendy apps; it's about dissecting the very heartbeat of innovation.

Let's get to the nitty-gritty of what's keeping me busy:
